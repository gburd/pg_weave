/*
 * src/query/uleven.c - byte-alphabet neighbourhood of a fixed 3-byte trigram.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS, because the comment it arrived with was wrong.  It
 * said "Mihov-Schulz universal Levenshtein automaton"; there is no automaton
 * here.  It brute-force enumerates the byte-alphabet neighbourhood of a
 * three-byte trigram (3*255 substitutions, 3*256 insertions truncated back to
 * three bytes, 3 deletions padded with a trailing 0) and de-duplicates the
 * result in O(n^2).  For k=2 it applies the k=1 transformation to every k=1
 * result.  Nothing in it is parameterized by a query, so nothing in it can
 * prune a vocabulary.
 *
 * Nor is the set it emits exactly "the trigrams within edit distance k": the
 * deletion cases emit a two-byte string zero-padded to three bytes, and the
 * insertion cases emit the first three bytes of a four-byte string, so the
 * output is a *funnel* -- deliberately over-generating, with the authoritative
 * TRE recheck at the heap behind it (see pg_weave_uleven_expand_cp's comment,
 * which states that soundness argument correctly).
 *
 * It stays, unchanged in behaviour, because src/query/tiling.c widens a regex
 * trigram spine with pg_weave_uleven_expand_cp() and a regex has no single
 * query term to build an automaton for.  What answers `term~k` is the
 * vocabulary-level automaton in include/weave/uleven.h (task Z5), which is
 * exact, prunes, and counts CHARACTERS rather than bytes.
 *
 * Two things a reader should know before trusting this file, both found while
 * writing that core and both left as they are rather than "improved", since
 * the on-disk trigram hashes and tiling's behaviour depend on it:
 *
 * 1. The k=2 path cannot succeed at any max_out a caller currently passes.  A
 *	  k=1 expansion is ~1537 trigrams before dedup, so the k=2 loop reaches
 *	  ~1537^2 = 2.36M and returns -1 (overflow) for any max_out below that.
 *	  tiling.c passes 4096, so a k>=2 tile ALWAYS falls back to always_true --
 *	  correct (always_true is the safe direction) but not what its comment
 *	  implies.
 * 2. It costs 48 KB of stack (uint8 temp[16384][3]) on every call, k=0
 *	  included.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - For k=0: return the input trigram only.
 * - For k=1: substitutions (3*255), insertions (4*256), deletions (3).
 * - For k=2: apply k=1 transformations recursively; dedupe.
 * - All expansions respect the global fanout cap to prevent DOS.

 * Codepoint-alphabet expansion (UTF-8 aware).

 * The byte-alphabet expansion above is only *complete* for trigrams whose

 * and no multibyte sequence contains an ASCII byte, so for an all-ASCII
 * trigram the byte neighbors and the codepoint neighbors coincide.  For a
 * trigram containing a codepoint > 0x7F, enumerating every codepoint
 * substitution/insertion (alphabet up to 0x10FFFF) would blow the fanout
 * budget, and the byte-level neighbors would not correspond to any
 * codepoint the index actually hashed.
 *
 * Soundness is preserved regardless: the pigeonhole tiling only requires
 * that alternative 0 be the *exact* trigram, and the heap recheck (TRE
 * regaexec) is authoritative.  So:
 *
 *   - all-ASCII trigram: expand in byte space (== codepoint space) and
 *     copy the results out as codepoints -- full k-neighborhood, same as
 *     before but now hashed as codepoints (previously these were also
 *     ASCII so the hashes matched; this keeps that behavior).
 *   - trigram with any codepoint > 0x7F: emit only the exact codepoint
 *     trigram.  Fewer alternatives (a tighter, still-correct filter);
 *     the recheck removes any false positive, and no *true* match is
 *     dropped because the exact trigram is always present in a matching
 *     text at edit distance 0 within its tile under the pigeonhole
 *     argument.
 *
 * This fixes the prior bug where extract_spine_from_ast dropped codepoints
 * > 0xFF entirely (corrupting trigram positions) and hashed 0x80..0xFF
 * codepoints as raw bytes (never matching the index's codepoint hashes),
 * i.e. silent false negatives on CJK/accented approximate queries.
