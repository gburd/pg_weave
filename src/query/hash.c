 * pg_tre source: src/util/hash.c.  Not part of the original 24-file import
 * (only its header, include/weave/hash.h, came across), which left
 * pg_weave_hash_trigram_cp() declared and undefined -- invisible until the
 * fuzzy sources entered OBJS in Z1, at which point the extension linked but
 * would not load: "could not load library ... undefined symbol:
 * pg_weave_hash_trigram_cp".  Added in Z1.
